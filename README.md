# phase-1-project

## Description
My phase-1-project is a medication recall catalog called 'MedRecalls'. MedRecalls is a JS application that leverages DOM manipulation to interact with the user. I built this project because as a licensed pharmacist I'm passionate about pharmacology and medication safety. My north star has always been centered around positive patient health experiences.
