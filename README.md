# phase-1-project

## Description
My phase-1-project is a medication recall catalog called 'MedRecalls'. MedRecalls is a JS application that leverages DOM manipulation to interact with the user. I built this project because I'm a NYS licensed pharmacist passionate about pharmacology and patient medication safety. ["https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/"] Check out [my blog](https://dev.to/minchulan/drug-recall-catalog-2dpe?preview=bf0618cc3023e85deff0e138b59565dfd488de934f119ffcf14e1c01c77be60e3558debe4c7e14817b311eceed702cc1da8ad0f0fe78ca251d93c8d0) to see the initial  design concept.
