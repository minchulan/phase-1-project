# phase-1-project

## Description
My phase-1-project is a drug recall catalog called 'Drug Recall Catalog' (DRC). DRC is a JS application that leverages DOM manipulation to interact with the user. I built this project because I'm a NYS licensed pharmacist passionate about pharmacology and patient medication safety. ["https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/"]

## Usage
To get started type `json-server --watch db.json` in the terminal to spin up the server and `open index.html (for macs) or `explorer.exe index.html` (for windows). The web app will load to an archive and search page where you can see all the drugs currently available, as well as create your own.
